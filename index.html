  <h2>Current Research Focus</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Deterministic Prime Readout via Admissibility.</strong><br>
      Develop a deterministic, oracle-free readout operator that recovers the next prime
      within a fixed window by eliminating non-admissible candidates.
      The approach treats primes as survivors of a structural admissibility law,
      not as outputs of a generative process.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Structural Admissibility and Regime Closure.</strong><br>
      Formalize admissibility as a scale-stable structural constraint,
      identifying distinct operational regimes and the minimal certification
      mechanism required to close survivor intrusions
      without expanding the base sieve.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Branch-Selective Log–Phase Dynamics.</strong><br>
      Model prime progression as a relation-driven update on
      logarithmic phase observables <em>(u, θ, σ)</em>,
      where evolution proceeds via branch selection among finite admissible laws,
      rather than probabilistic generation.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Invariant Persistence under Scaling.</strong><br>
      Test whether observed symmetry and doublet invariants persist
      under scale extension, supporting their interpretation
      as structural constraints rather than finite-size or grid artifacts.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Structural Closure Track: RH to Readout.</strong><br>
      Maintain a consistent same-observable pipeline connecting
      explicit-formula resonance constraints
      to unconditional mean-square control,
      framing the Riemann Hypothesis as a structural closure condition
      rather than a standalone spectral conjecture.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Research Principles</h2>
  <ul class="bullets">
    <li>
      <strong>No guesswork.</strong>
      Only mechanisms that survive systematic ablations
      (reference on/off, filter on/off, regime stress tests)
      are considered structurally meaningful.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Hard falsifiability.</strong>
      If a readout operator fails to generalize across scales or windows,
      the hypothesis is rejected without revision.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Minimal assumptions, maximal structure.</strong>
      Known sources of artificial coherence
      (perfect powers, small-period alignments, grid artifacts)
      are removed before any structural claim is made.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Implementation-first.</strong>
      A theoretical construct earns legitimacy
      only when it compiles into a working, verifiable readout engine.
    </li>
  </ul>
