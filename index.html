  <h2>Current Research Focus</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Prime Prediction via Admissibility Selection.</strong><br>
      Develop a “readout” operator that predicts prime gaps by selecting the unique
      stable candidate from an admissible set
      (square–free filtering, small–factor screening, and head selection).
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Branch–Selective Log–Phase Dynamics.</strong><br>
      Model prime progression as a relation–driven update on
      <em>(u, θ, σ)</em>, where phase laws switch via a finite–state
      branch variable (selection, not generation).
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Invariant Persistence and Scaling.</strong><br>
      Test whether the doublet and symmetry invariants
      remain invariant under scale extension,
      supporting their role as structural constraints
      rather than finite-size artifacts.
    </li>


    <li>
      <strong>RH–to–Readout Interface (supporting track).</strong><br>
      Maintain a consistent “same observable” pipeline linking
      explicit–formula resonance constraints to structural
      mean–square control.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Research Principle</h2>
  <ul class="bullets">
    <li><strong>No guesswork:</strong> I only trust mechanisms that survive ablations (reference on/off, filter on/off, scaling stress tests).</li>
    <li><strong>Hard falsifiability:</strong> If the operator can’t generalize, the hypothesis is rejected.</li>
    <li><strong>Minimal assumptions, maximal structure:</strong> Remove known sources of coherence (squares / small-period artifacts) before claiming “laws.”</li>
    <li><strong>Implementation-first:</strong> A theory earns its right to exist only when it compiles into a working readout engine.</li>
  </ul>
