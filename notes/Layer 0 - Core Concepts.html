       C. 핵심 수식 (존재방정식/정의방정식)
       ===================== -->
  <h2>C. Core Equations</h2>

<h3>C.1 Definition of the observable</h3>

<pre>
A_\phi(U,L;\beta)
=
\sum_{u \in \Lambda \cap [U,U+L]}
w(u)\,\phi_L(u-U)\,e^{-i\beta u}
</pre>

<p>
  Logarithmically localized exponential observable.
  The window location <em>U</em> and length <em>L</em> determine the region of
  observation, while <em>β</em> is the dual frequency variable.
  This observable is fixed once and for all throughout the analysis.
</p>

<p class="source">
  Source: extracted from <em>Layer 0 — Core Proof Engine</em>, Ch.2.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>C.2 Intrinsic energy scale</h3>

<pre>
M_\phi(U,L)
=
\sum_{u \in \Lambda \cap [U,U+L]}
w(u)^2\,|\phi_L(u-U)|^2
</pre>

<p>
  Intrinsic energy associated with the observable.
  All upper and lower bounds are measured relative to this scale.
  Uniform estimates require constants that do not depend on the window length
  <em>L</em>.
</p>

<p class="source">
  Source: extracted from <em>Layer 0 — Core Proof Engine</em>, Ch.2.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>C.3 Normalization of the window</h3>

<pre>
\phi_L(x) = \eta(x/L)\,e^{x/2},
\qquad \eta \in C_c^\infty([0,1]),\ \eta \ge 0,\ \int_0^1 \eta(x)\,dx = 1
</pre>

<p>
  The exponential factor <em>e^{x/2}</em> aligns the observable with the critical
  line normalization in the Weil–Guinand explicit formula.
  This choice separates exponential amplification from polynomial background
  growth.
</p>

<p class="source">

</p>

<hr />

<h3>C.4 Existence-style lower bound (forced amplification)</h3>

<pre>
If there exists a nontrivial zero
ρ_0 = σ_0 + iγ_0 with σ_0 &gt; 1/2,
then for sufficiently large L
there exists U = U(L) such that

|A_\phi(U,L;γ_0)|^2
\ge
c_\phi^2\,M_\phi(U,L)\,e^{2(\sigma_0-1/2)L}.
</pre>

<p>
  Off–critical-line zeros force exponential amplification of the fixed observable
  at the resonant frequency <em>β = γ_0</em>.
  The constant <em>c<sub>φ</sub></em> is independent of <em>L</em>.
</p>

<p class="source">
  Source: extracted from <em>Layer 0 — Core Proof Engine</em>, Ch.3.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>C.5 Uniform mean–square upper bound</h3>

<pre>
\int_{U_0}^{U_0+L}
|A_\phi(U,L;\beta)|^2\,dU
\le
C_{\phi,\varepsilon}\,L^{1+\varepsilon}\,
\sup_{U} M_\phi(U,L)
\qquad (\forall\,\beta \in \mathbb{R}).
</pre>

<p>
  Uniform mean–square control of the same observable over window translations.
  The implicit constant <em>C<sub>φ,ε</sub></em> is independent of <em>L</em>,
  <em>U</em>, and <em>β</em>.
</p>

<p class="source">
  Source: extracted from <em>Layer 0 — Core Proof Engine</em>, Ch.4.2.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>C.6 Mean–square collision principle</h3>

<pre>
Exponential lower bounds and uniform polynomial mean–square upper bounds
cannot simultaneously hold for the same fixed observable as L → ∞.
</pre>

<p>
  When both C.4 and C.5 apply to the same observable with the same normalization,
  their growth rates are incompatible.
  This incompatibility excludes the existence of off–critical-line zeros.

       D. 사용 규칙/해석 규칙 (짧게)
       ===================== -->
<h2>D. Reading Rules</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Fixed-object rule.</strong><br />
    All statements, bounds, and comparisons refer to the same fixed observable
    <em>A<sub>φ</sub>(U,L;β)</em> defined in Section C.1.
    No result obtained for a different observable may be transferred to it.
  </li>
  <p class="source">
    Source: extracted from <em>Layer 0 — Core Proof Engine</em>, Ch.1–2.
  </p>

  <li>
    <strong>Same normalization rule.</strong><br />
    Every estimate is measured relative to the intrinsic energy scale
    <em>M<sub>φ</sub>(U,L)</em>.
    No re-scaling, smoothing, or renormalization is permitted between bounds.
  </li>
  <p class="source">
    Source: extracted from <em>Layer 0 — Core Proof Engine</em>, Ch.2.
  </p>

  <li>
    <strong>Uniformity rule.</strong><br />
    Unless explicitly stated otherwise, all implicit constants are independent
    of the window length <em>L</em>.
    Dependence on <em>U</em> or <em>β</em> must be stated explicitly.
  </li>
  <p class="source">
    Source: extracted from <em>Layer 0 — Core Proof Engine</em>, Ch.2 and App.~A.3.
  </p>

  <li>
    <strong>Filter scope rule.</strong><br />
    Filters restrict only the support set <em>Λ</em>.
    They do not alter the observable, its normalization, or the form of the
    explicit formula.
  </li>
  <p class="source">
    Source: extracted from <em>Layer 0 — Core Proof Engine</em>, Ch.2.
  </p>

  <li>
    <strong>Existential interpretation rule.</strong><br />
    Statements asserting the existence of a window location <em>U</em> are to be
    read as existence claims only.
    No uniformity in <em>U</em> is implied unless explicitly stated.
  </li>
  <p class="source">
    Source: extracted from <em>Layer 0 — Core Proof Engine</em>, Ch.3.
  </p>

  <li>
    <strong>Collision reading rule.</strong><br />
    The mean–square collision principle applies only when the exponential lower
    bound and the polynomial mean–square upper bound are imposed on the same
    observable with the same normalization.
  </li>
