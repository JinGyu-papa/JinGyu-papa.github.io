<h1>Core Research Framework</h1>

<p>
This page records the central structural framework underlying my current
independent research program.
</p>

<p>
The framework was developed to address limitations in existing approaches
and serves as the organizing principle for subsequent results and manuscripts.
</p>

<p>
Detailed formulations, applications, and extensions are documented
in associated research notes and archived manuscripts.
</p>

<p>
This page functions as a public, timestamped reference point
for the core ideas of the program.
